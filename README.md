# Tetro
This game was made by me alone between October, 30<sup>th</sup> and November, 2<sup>nd</sup> 2020 for the **WeeklyGameJam Week 160** on the theme *Nothing stays forever*. I made it entirely in VB.NET without using a game engine.

It ranked 49 out of 72 overall, and 26<sup>th</sup> in Game Mechanics.
